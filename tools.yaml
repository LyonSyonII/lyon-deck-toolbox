- title: SteamOS Btrfs
  description: |
    Btrfs is an alternative linux filesystem that allows to compress all files automatically, potentially saving a lot of storage.
    It can be especially useful to users of the 64GB deck model.
    This injector will install the necessary payload to keep a btrfs formatted /home even through system updates.
    Features:
     - Btrfs /home conversion from ext4 (optional)
     - Btrfs, f2fs, ext4, fat, exfat, ntfs formatted SD card support
     - Btrfs, f2fs, ext4, fat, exfat, ntfs formating of SD card
     - Progress dialog and logging during the home conversion!
     - Install additional pacman packages into the rootfs automatically and persist through updates
     - Survives updates and branch changes!
     - Steam's downloading and temp folders as subvolumes with COW disabled
     - Update check
     - Non-linux filesystems (fat, exfat, ntfs) have their compatdata folder bind mounted from the internal storage for proton support by default (and don't forget that with fat you are restricted to a maximum of 4GB per file!)
  note: Read all the instructions in the repository carefully, though easy to install it can have unexpected side effects, some Linux knowledge is advised.
